# Audit

## Security audit

Our V4 platform has completed an independent external audit of all on-chain code. The auditors examined the logic, checked for common vulnerabilities, and reviewed our security controls. Their report included several recommendations, all of which have been implemented to align the platform with best-practice standards in the DeFi sector.

## Scope of the audit

The audit covered every component that executes on chain. Off-chain infrastructureâ€”such as the web interface, servers, and ancillary scriptsâ€”was reviewed internally by the team but was not part of the external audit's formal scope.

## Assurance level

Because the core logic that handles user funds resides on chain and has passed an external security review, users can interact with the protocol knowing that the critical blockchain layer has been rigorously tested. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor and refine the off-chain environment and will commission additional reviews as the platform evolves.
