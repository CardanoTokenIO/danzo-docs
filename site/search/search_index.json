Furthermore, whereas a ponzi scheme fools investors who are unaware of the scheme's operations, the hodlCoin game is fully transparent, its rules are clear and players are aware of them. Finally, whereas a Ponzi scheme is unstable and invariably leads to collapse, hodlCoin is conjectured to enjoy a self-stabilizing effect: if the price of the underlying asset is falling and players start to un-hodl to sell the underlying asset, this may encourage other players to hodl to benefit from the fees paid by those who are un-hodling; this may reduce the selling pressure on the underlying asset.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"getting-started/the-casino/","title":"The Casino","text":"<p>Experience the thrill of the game!</p> <p>Welcome to DANZO Casino, the ultimate gambling hub where 100% of profits are burned, making DANZO deflationary.
