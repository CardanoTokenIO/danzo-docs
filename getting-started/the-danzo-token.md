# The DANZO Token

The **$DANZO** token launched fairly in **June 2024**, raising **6,900 ADA** exclusively for the initial liquidity pool and allocating **50%** of the supply to a tightly-controlled presale. Since then, additional tokens have entered circulation as the treasury has funded maintenance and operating costs, expanding the float and, at first glance, making the supply appear less scarce to new investors.

Yet $DANZO's economics are deliberately designed to create constant buying pressure: the token captures value from both the **Danzo Casino** and the **Danzo Arena**, plus every external token integrated into either platform. To illustrate, imagine our ever-diligent mascot **BuyBack Elephant**—quietly scooping $DANZO off the open market. To date, the Elephant has absorbed **more than 130,000 ADA** worth of tokens through these automated buy-backs.

## Value-accretion mechanics

* **Casino profits (in $DANZO)** – 100% are immediately **burned**.
* **Partner-casino tokens** – 10% of their profits, and **casino profits in ADA** – 2%, are swapped for $DANZO and **burned**.
* **Arena exits** – 2% of every $DANZO withdrawal is **burned**.
* **Partner-arena tokens** – 1% of each exit is converted to $DANZO and **burned**.
* **DEX trades** – 1.5% of every swap (half of the 3% LP fee in place since launch) is permanently **removed from circulation**.

These continuous burns and buy-backs tighten supply while the project grows, aligning long-term holders with the success of the Danzo ecosystem. For a deeper dive into the flow of funds—or just to chat—join us on Discord any time.
