Danzo Bonanza offers a 95.76% RTP (Return to Player) with a maximum payout of x2000 on a single spin! The RTP represents the expected return to the player after 1 million spins. First, we calculate the theoretical RTP, and after conducting numerous simulations with 1 million spins, we fine-tune the final figure. Traditional online slots typically have an RTP of 95–98%, so Danzo Bonanza is definitely player-friendly in comparison. Here are the detailed odds:

Danzo Crash is the most popular and most played game. It gives you the full experience of trading a shitcoin in just a few seconds — no need for buyers to pump the number up, and no need for exit liquidity to cash in your profits!

The concept is simple: the number goes up until it crashes. If you manage to cash out before the crash, you earn profits equal to your bet multiplied by the current multiplier at the time of your exit.
